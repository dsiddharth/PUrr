<h2> Elevator Speach </h2>
<p>Right now, reserving a residential college room for a meeting or event is a real pain. There is no one repository for information regarding attributes and possible booking hours for a room, and the websites for actually booking a room are likewise decentralized. Moreover, the system is poorly automated for college administrators who have to check individual emails to approve them as well as manually advertise when rooms will be unavailable.</p>

<p>Our goal is to streamline the process on both sides as well as improve the search experience for users who need a specific type of room. We plan to do this by having a two sided server which will contain calendar information for all the residential college rooms which are available to be booked. Administrators will be able to specify how far in advance students will be able to book, block off days for college events and determine what sort of credentials will be needed to book a room. After a small set up period, administrators will rarely be required to actively approve/requests: although they will be able to see who has reserved when.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, students will have booking, room information and search services for all buildings consolidated in one webpage. You can search for rooms based on capacity, equipment availability and time availability among other things. Each room will have an information page which lists these features along with a photo and recent usage history. Hopefully these features will lead to students using the room which suits their need best instead of being limited only to rooms they already know.</p>

<p>Excluding some authentication and room searching details, this structure is very general and should very easily allows us to manage room reservation for all residential colleges as well as other places (such as the music building). We do require information on all the rooms which we plan to make available as well as the ability to interface with the university's authentication system but neither of these should be difficult to obtain.</p>

<p>Ultimately, we hope that this project will greatly simplify an important task for both students and college officials.</p>
