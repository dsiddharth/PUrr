<h2> Overview </h2>

<p>University students often need to reserve rooms in buildings spread throughout the campus tailored to their specific needs. A club president might need a room with a projector, which can accommodate a crowd of at least a certain size. Or maybe a department head needs to reserve an auditorium with the proper presentation capabilities to get that mission critical conference rolling smoothly. PUrr,  or Princeton University Room Registrar, will be able to gather requirements from users and offer suggestions of rooms that would suit them.</p>

<p>Currently, the only available solution is extremely rudimentary, as users can only send in request via e-mail to Dean ____________ . PUrr will give users a multitude of options to search for a room that is both available during the time of their choosing and custom tailored to meet their needs. They will be presented with a visual search page, that would allow them to choose a building, and subsequently room, based on what is available during the user specified time frame from a virtual campus map. The map will be interactive, starting by showing all potential room and buildings before the user begins to specify their needs. As the user begins to input her requirements, the rooms that match their needs will remain on the interactive map, while the others are removed. The results will be real-time, removing rooms as soon as they are booked and follow a first come, first served basis. </p>

<p>PUrr will initially be running on the Computer Science s Penguins servers in one our group s public_html folder, and will later be moved to a location of s choice. Our project will be running on the Apache Web Server on 64-bit Red Hat linux installations managed by the Computer Science department. To handle dynamic content from the server side, we will be using Python. On the client end, we will be using a mix of javascript, AJAX, CSS, and HTML5 to properly display the necessary information. As a reach goal, we will attempt to write an iOS application, which will either become an extension to the Princeton University app or its own separate app in the iTunes Store. </p>

<h2> Requirements </h2>
<p> This web application will make it possible to easily reserve rooms on campus. From the perspective of a student -- say the president of a small student club -- this system will make it easy and painless for her to find an open room that meets her specifications (availability, size, has a projector, etc).
